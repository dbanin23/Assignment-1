    <h1>Report</h1>
    <p>
        Through out my experience learning codes on the code app visual studio code I've learnt so much as I did think
        it would be very difficult as I would usually find python hard at times but it turnt out it was different than I
        expected it was easy to learn due to my lecturer chris making it easy and put videos out there so we it can be
        under throughly and can be rewatched as many times if needed. From learning basic tags such p tags, h1,link and
        more it started of nice then there was so many codes i didn't think i would remember it all to be honest i still
        don't but i've learnt much more than I anticipated.
        Due to this experience I want to learn more HMTL and CSS codes and Javascriot soon after I get some more pratice
        with what i already known. Many other things which I didn't think I was capable is creating a website and mobile
        application let alone adding animations to it, this was mind blowing. I add fonts and colors which made the
        website look excellent and the colors that I chose I think it fits the vibe and goes well.
        I was able to an image on the using the image and websites from other sources using the link tag. I know there
        is a lot I can improve but this is where i start praticing and learn all these new skills to put to use and soon
        become a pro at it as it would be a nice to add to the additon.
